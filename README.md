# Collaborative Reality Editor

Organize, prioritize, and transform thoughts into actionable results. Real-time synchronization, privacy-first principles, and semantic processing. A flexible and efficient collaborative environment.

## Features

### Thought Management

- **Synchronized TODO Lists:** Create, prioritize, and manage tasks collaboratively.
- **Thought Evolution:** Convert ideas into agents capable of automating and achieving goals.
- **Privacy by Default:** All objects are private unless explicitly shared.

### Search and Matching

- **Persistent Queries:** Indefinite objects act as ongoing search intents, persisting until matched with real-world data.
- **Semantic Matching:** Translates natural language into JSON for large-scale alignment.
- **Community Schema:** Shared schemas ensure consistent object interpretation.
- **Notifications:** Matches to shared objects are delivered as replies.

### Peer-to-Peer Networking

- **Decentralized Collaboration:**
  - Uses WebRTC for peer-to-peer communication, reducing reliance on centralized servers.
  - Supernodes optionally support large-scale coordination and fallback.

- **Efficient Synchronization:**
  - Built on `yjs` CRDT for incremental updates and offline editing.

- **Peer Discovery:**
  - Uses WebRTC signaling and protocols like libp2p for dynamic peer discovery and matchmaking.

- **Data Security:**
  - End-to-end encryption protects private and shared data.
  - Granular access controls allow detailed sharing permissions.

### User Interface

- **Main View:** Unified interface for viewing, creating, and editing objects.
- **Sidebar Navigation:**
  - **Me:** User profile and preferences.
  - **Friends:** Status updates from connections.
  - **Network:** Peer activity and traffic visualization.
  - **Database:** Sortable, filterable statistical tables.
- **Dark Mode:** Default theme for visual comfort.

## Design

### Frontend

- **Architecture:**
  - Single-page application using TypeScript/JavaScript.
  - Dynamic components for flexibility and reusability.
  - `yjs` ensures real-time collaborative editing.

### Backend

- **Server:**
  - Node.js-based optional supernode for plugin integration and fallback synchronization.
- **Database:**
  - Combines in-memory caching and persistent storage for durability and scalability.
  - Supports decentralized storage options like IPFS.

### Network

- **Synchronization:**
  - WebRTC enables direct peer-to-peer communication.
  - Incremental delta synchronization ensures low-latency updates.
- **Fallback Coordination:**
  - Supernodes assist with recovery and long-term storage.
- **Security:**
  - Encrypted transmission and fine-grained access controls.

### Implementation

  - `vite` for fast development and optimized builds.
  - Modular, maintainable design.
- **Testing:**
  - `vitest` for unit and integration testing.
  - Continuous integration ensures stability.
- **Code Standards:**
  - Clean, self-documenting ES6+ code.
