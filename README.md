Develop a client-side p2p search index web application.

* Language: "Vanilla" ES6 JavaScript, object-oriented architecture
* Networking: libp2p + GossipSub
* Search Index: FlexSearch.js
* Storage: IndexedDB/PouchDB
* User-interface: jQuery + HTML Web Components

Create the project and a top-level skeleton that integrates all the components and their interactions.

Choose popular, proven build setup that is reliable, low-maintenance, and automates as much of the development process as possible.

Keep the design as simple as possible, without limiting its potential for growth. Avoid overengineering and avoid excessively verbose/pedantic identifiers and design patterns.  Keep the code clear and compact.  Use comments sparingly, prefering self-documenting code.  Use the latest Javascript language features.  Involve no more than a few helpful common utility libraries.  If possible, find ways to generate and minimize the necessary code through clever object-oriented design and metaprogramming.
