A TODO-List application which uses a Language Model to generate machine-readable JSON objects from the text.  Then these documents are shared in a p2p network (gossip protocol) for searching and matching.
* Items: Creation, Editing, and Deleting
* Listing: filter, and sort by date or tags
* Search: a search is a reified TODO item to which results, locally AND network (results can stream in at any time), are 'attached' in a reply-to way

The purpose of converting TODO items to JSON objects is to facilitate semantic matching of objects, at scale.  Object tags (of which there may be >=0) provide a divide-and-conquer approach to the quadratic combinations.

Create the project and a top-level skeleton that integrates all the components and their interactions.

* Language: "Vanilla" ES6 JavaScript, object-oriented architecture
* User-interface: jQuery + HTML Web Components (1 dynamically-generated page)
* Build setup: 'vite'

Keep the design as simple as possible, without limiting its potential for growth. Avoid overengineering and avoid excessively verbose/pedantic identifiers and design patterns.  Keep the code clear and compact.  Use comments sparingly, prefering self-documenting code.  Use the latest Javascript language features.  Involve no more than a few helpful common utility libraries.  If possible, find ways to generate and minimize the necessary code through clever object-oriented design and metaprogramming.

Design an HTML/JS text input widget with the following feature:

Upon saving, it converts the text into a JSON object, through Language Model prompting, in order to enable semantic processing of quantifiable and qualitative description content.  This internal representation can be shown in a summary, for user's disclosure and correction.  It will call an OpenAI-compatible JSON endpoint, running on localhost, by populating the request's system-prompt with to-be-developed JSONize instructions, and the prompt with the text.  Quick linting of the parse for extraneous text above and below the parseable JSON { } may need to be removed.

Make a smoothly flowing user-experience.  Provide unobtrusive feedback that will help the developers and users know what is happening.

Don't assume anything important!  If you have questions, ask me before writing code that could be wrong.

- No need for a 'completion state' toggle.  Just a small delete 'x' button, with confirmation.
- Use IndexedDB through an appropriate DB library, like PouchDB or something better.
- Allow changing the item order by drag and drop
- Abstract generic widgets that can be flexibly applied in other ways than this prototype requires

Integrate the included web application components into a complete cohesive web application focused in a Personal TODO List.

Refactor the user-interface into more cohesive and conventional experience. Identify missing potential integration points between components that will enhance functionality and value.

Each item can asynchronously accumulate replies from semantically matched content.  The purpose of the JSON representation is to enable matching at scale.  This entire process can happen automatically and transparently as a result of simply saving an item.  JSON view can be toggled on, shown in an editable textarea, allowing a manual override.

Style/UX: minimalistic, beautiful, does not waste white space, prefer larger fonts, built-in emoticon icons.

Network state visualized in a corner icon with an icon state and optional animated blinking lights.  Quick-add peer input, and quick "copy my peerID" to share.

Include user profile editor.  When displaying peers, include their name.

Retain the 'vanilla' ES6 JavaScript code patterns we are currently using.  Do not introduce extra libraries without extreme justification.  DO NOT use React.

**Proposal for Enhancing the P2P Todo List Application with Semantic Matching**

**Introduction**

The current system is a P2P Todo List application built with vanilla ES6 JavaScript, leveraging PeerJS for peer-to-peer networking and Dexie.js for local storage. While it allows users to share todo items across the network, it lacks the ability to semantically understand and match items based on their content. Additionally, classes like `SemanticInput` and `LanguageModel` are defined but not utilized within the application.

**Proposed Revisions**

To maximize utility and value, I propose integrating semantic processing into the application to enable machine-readable semantic quantifiers for matching todo items at scale. This involves:

1. **Integrating `SemanticInput` and `LanguageModel`**: Utilize these classes to process user input, extract structured data, and generate metadata for each todo item.

2. **Semantic Annotation of Todo Items**: When a user adds a new todo item, the application uses the language model to generate a semantic representation (e.g., intent, categories, priorities).

3. **Enhanced P2P Messaging**: Modify the P2P network to include semantic metadata when broadcasting messages. This allows peers to perform semantic matching and prioritize relevant items.

4. **Semantic Matching and Filtering**: Implement functionality on the client side to filter and display incoming todo items based on semantic relevance to the user's interests or current context.

5. **User Interface Enhancements**: Update the UI to display semantic information and provide controls for users to set their preferences or interests.

**Implementation Details**

1. **Processing User Input with SemanticInput**

   ```javascript
   // When adding a new item
   async addItem(text) {
     try {
       // Process text to extract semantic data
       const llmResult = await this.languageModel.process(text);
       const semanticData = llmResult; // Assume it returns structured data

       const id = await this.store.add({
         text,
         semanticData, // Store semantic metadata
         source: 'local',
       });

       // Broadcast item with semantic data
       this.node.broadcast({ text, semanticData });
       await this.loadItems();
       toast('Item added');
       return id;
     } catch (e) {
       toast('Failed to add item', 'error');
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Updating the P2PNode to Handle Semantic Data**

   ```javascript
   // Modify the handleMessage function to process semantic data
   handleMessage(senderId, message) {
     if (message.type === 'BROADCAST') {
       const { content } = message;
       if (content.semanticData) {
         // Perform semantic matching
         if (this.matchesUserInterests(content.semanticData)) {
           // Add item to todo list
           todo.addRemoteItem(content);
         }
       }
     }
     // ... existing code ...
   }

   matchesUserInterests(semanticData) {
     // Implement logic to determine if the item matches user preferences
     // For example, check categories or keywords
     return true; // Placeholder
   }
   ```

3. **User Interface Enhancements**

    - **Semantic Filters**: Add UI elements that allow users to specify interests or filter criteria.

      ```html
      <!-- In your HTML -->
      <div id="filters">
        <label>
          <input type="checkbox" name="category" value="work"> Work
        </label>
        <label>
          <input type="checkbox" name="category" value="personal"> Personal
        </label>
        <!-- Additional filters -->
      </div>
      ```

    - **Displaying Semantic Metadata**: Modify the `createListItem` method to display semantic information.

      ```javascript
      createListItem(item) {
        // ... existing code ...
        const semanticInfo = h('div', { class: 'semantic-info' },
          `Category: ${item.semanticData.category}`
        );
        return h('div', { class: 'item', 'data-id': item.id },
          // ... existing elements ...
          semanticInfo
        );
      }
      ```

4. **Leveraging Machine-Readable Semantic Quantifiers**

    - **At Scale Matching**: By annotating items with semantic metadata, the application can efficiently match and distribute relevant todo items among peers, even as the network scales.

    - **Use of Standard Ontologies**: Incorporate standard vocabularies or ontologies (e.g., schema.org, FOAF) to ensure consistency in semantic annotations.

**Who Would Use This Application?**

- **Remote Teams**: Distributed teams that need to share and synchronize tasks efficiently.

- **Community Projects**: Open-source projects where contributors can broadcast tasks and find relevant issues to work on.

- **Interest-Based Networks**: Users connected by shared interests (e.g., hobbyists, researchers) who want to share tasks or knowledge items pertinent to their fields.

- **Educational Groups**: Students collaborating on assignments or study groups sharing resources.

**Maximizing Utility and Value**

- **Enhanced Collaboration**: Semantic matching ensures users receive only relevant tasks, reducing noise and increasing productivity.

- **Scalability**: As the network grows, semantic quantifiers help manage the influx of data, ensuring the system remains efficient.

- **Personalization**: Users can tailor their experience by setting preferences, leading to higher engagement.

**Retaining Code Style**

All proposed changes adhere to the existing code style:

- **Vanilla Web-Browser ES6**: No frameworks or modules are introduced.

- **No External Dependencies**: The enhancements utilize existing classes and patterns within the codebase.

**Conclusion**

By integrating semantic processing and enhancing the P2P networking capabilities, the application evolves into a powerful tool for collaborative task management and knowledge sharing. It leverages machine-readable semantic quantifiers to enable efficient matching at scale, providing significant utility and value to various user groups.

**Next Steps**

- **Implement Semantic Processing**: Fully integrate `SemanticInput` and `LanguageModel` classes.

- **Develop Matching Algorithms**: Create robust methods for semantic matching based on user preferences.

- **User Testing**: Gather feedback from potential users to refine the matching criteria and UI elements.

- **Security Considerations**: Ensure data transmitted over the network is secure and consider implementing encryption if necessary.
