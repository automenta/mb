# Semantic Input Widget

A text input component that bridges natural language and structured data through LM-powered semantic parsing. The widget enables fluid conversion between human-written text and JSON representations, supporting both human readability and machine processing.

## Core Functionality

### User Interface
- Clean, minimal textarea for natural text input
- Progressive disclosure of JSON representation
- Real-time status updates during processing
- Bidirectional editing (text â†” JSON)
- Validation feedback and automatic retry logic
- Responsive layout adapting to available space

### Processing Pipeline
1. Captures user text input
2. Sends to LM endpoint with structured prompting
3. Cleans and validates returned JSON
4. Presents structured data for review/editing
5. Maintains both representations in sync

### Data Model
Core fields extracted from text:
- tags/categories for classification
- creation metadata (timestamp, author)
- content summary and key points
- extensible for domain-specific fields
